# HMM-SMC

Project done with G. Sarr and A. Poncin for the Hidden Markov Models and Sequential Monte Carlo course

In this project we implement and evaluate the classifier proposed in the paper PAC-Bayesian AUC classification and scoring (https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1771). We define a risk function and use an SMC sampler to generate samples from the posterior distribution of the scoring coefficients. More detailed information is available in the report.
